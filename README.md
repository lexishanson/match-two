# Match Two

Match Two is a 52-card matching memory game with the goal of finding card pairs, to be played either alone or against computer.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, `npm install`, then `npm start`

Game will be served on localhost: 3000

## How to Play

* To start, select "By Myself" if you'd like to play alone, or "Against Computer" if you'd like a challenge. The "Computer" player has a perfect memory, so it's hard to beat!

* Cards will be shuffled and displayed on the board. Select two cards to flip over to see if they are a match. A match is based on the _value_ of the card, not the suit.

* If you don't find a match, try to remember where the cards are located!

* If playing 2-player, Computer will take it's turn next. Wait a moment and watch the status at the top of the screen to see what the Computer selected.

* Continue playing until all 52 card have been matched. If playing 2-player, you'll be told if you or the computer won.


## TODO

* Break out computer's move and matches section into separate components
* In 2-player mode, make Computer's flipped cards more visible in UI so that user (P1) can more easily see them
